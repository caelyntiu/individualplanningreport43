This dataset records 196 observations over 7 variables, both demographic and behavioral characteristics of a player such as experience level, gender, total playtime, and age. These variables provide insights to each player's profile and allows us to analyze the factors that may influence if a player would subscribe to a game-related newsletter.

    "### Potential Issues and Limitations\n",
    "While the dataset provides valuable information about the players, there are potential issues and limitations that may affect the quality and accuracy of the analysis. First, not all players chose to disclose demographic variables such as `Age` and `gender`, which makes the entries missing or incomplete. This can reduce the efficiency of the sample size and may shift the results. Another possible problem is that the number of players who subscribed to the newsletter versus the players who didn't may cause an imbalance, and could affect the performance of the classification model and lead to biased predictions. Another issue is that the experience level is self-reported and may not accurately show a player's true skill in the game unless this was accurately classified with another study. The `played_hours` variable could potentially have outliers as well and could skew the overall analysis if left unnoticed. "

    "The broad question answered in this project is Question 1: \"What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\" From this question, the specific question I made is : \"Can the experience of the players predict if they would  subscribe to a game-related newsletter?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The question I made is about exploring whether there is a correlation between a player's experience level (classified as Amateur, Beginner, Regular, Pro, or Veteran), and their likelihood to subscribe to the game newsletter. This question aims to determine if players with higher experience levels are more likely to stay updated about the game through newsletter or not. Other variables such as `played_hours`, `age`and `gender` may also be considered later to see if they influence the likelihood of subscribing to newsletters when put side by side with experience level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data from `players.csv`will help address my question because it contains the key variable, `subscribe`, which indicates whether a player has subscribed to the game-related newsletter, while exploratory variables such as `experience`, `played_hours`, `Age`, and `gender`describe a player's characteristics that may influence this outcome. Before putting this data through a predictive model, it is important to perform data wrangling first to make sure any missing values or outliers are accounted for. Variables such as `experience`, `gender`, and `subscribe` will be converted into factor types since they are categorical variables. After tidying the data, the data will be split into training and testing sets for model validation. These steps ensure that the final dataset is properly formatted, consistent and ready to use for predictive analysis.\n",
